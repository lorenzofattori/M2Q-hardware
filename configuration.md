# Change M2Q Configuration

You can change the configuration of M2Q via the built-in web server.
In order to access the web server, plug a PC to the M2Q **Ethernet** port. Then power on M2Q via USB. You can also connect M2Q to a switch (Chamsys built-in switch is also fine) and plug the PC to the same network.
Using a web browser, go to M2Q IP Address, default is 2.0.0.100.

**Note: after changing M2Q IP Address, the web page will be accessible to the new address!
Remember which IP you set, otherwise you will not be able to access the cofniguration webpage anymore!
